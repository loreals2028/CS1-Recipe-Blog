  <h2>üçù Eggplant Parmesan</h2>
  <img src="vegan-eggplant-parmesan.jpg" width="65%">


<h3> Description:</h3>
<p>This Vegan Eggplant Parmesean is a great dish to make for your friends and family. This recipe is dairy and egg-free and skips the extra step of turning it into a casserole. Instead you can enjoy these crispy fried eggplant slices topped with marinara sauce and basil with a side of spaghetti.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 eggplant</li>
<li>1/4 cup all Purpose Flour</li>
<li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>2 tbsp vegan parmesan </li>
  <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
  <li>1/2 cup unsweetened plain almond milk</li>
  <li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
  <li> 8 ounces pasta</li>
  <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
  


</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Slice eggplant into thin rounds slightly less than 1/2 inch thick, and sprinkle each side liberally with sea salt. Arrange in a circular pattern in a colander and place in the sink to draw out the bitter taste of the eggplant.
  </li>
  <li>Let rest for 15 minutes, then rinse and arrange on a clean absorbent kitchen towel. Top with another clean dish towel and lay a baking sheet on top. Place something heavy on top, such as a cast iron skillet, to thoroughly dry for at least 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>In the meantime, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with foil and spritz with nonstick spray. Also, if making pasta, bring water to a boil in a large saucepan.</li>
  <li>Prepare your dipping stations by placing almond milk + cornstarch in one bowl; flour in another bowl; and bread crumbs + sea salt + oregano + vegan parmesan (or nutritional yeast) in another bowl.</li>
  <li>Once thoroughly dry, dip eggplant slices in flour, then almond milk mixture, then breadcrumbs. Arrange on the baking sheet and pop in oven to bake for a total of 20-30 minutes.
</li>
  <li>IMPORTANT STEP: While the eggplant is in the oven, bring a large skillet to medium heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp olive oil (or sub avocado oil // adjust amount if altering default number of servings) and pull 3-4 eggplant rounds out of the oven at a time and saut√© to give them extra crisp and texture. Cook for ~2 minutes on each side (or browned) and then return to oven to continue crisping. Do this in batches until all rounds are browned.</li>
  <li>While eggplant is browning in the oven, prepare marinara. I prefer adding my tomato sauce and spices to a serving bowl and microwaving to warm, but you could also heat it on the stove. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Once done cooking, drain pasta and cover with a towel to keep warm. Set aside.
</li>
  <li>To serve: Plate pasta and eggplant slices and marinara in a dish as a dipping sauce. Additional vegan parmesan cheese makes an excellent topper.

<h2>ü•ó Vegetable Pasta Salad</h2>
  <img src="vegan-summer-pasta.jpg" width="60%">

<h3> Description:</h3>
<p>This is a simple summer pasta recipe for you to prepare after long day of school or work. It uses the best of summer produce: zucchini, ripe tomatoes, grilled artichokes and Kalamata olives and can be thrown together in a matter of minutes.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>200 g / 7 oz rigatoni or penne pasta (GF if needed)
<li>20 ml / 4 tsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>200 g / 7 oz courgette / zucchini (1 medium), cut into chunks</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
<li>salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>2 large ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
<li>8 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>a good pinch of sugar (optional)</li>
<li>2 tsp balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>a good pinch of chilli flakes (I used fine Korean chilli flakes)</li>
<li>4 charred artichoke heart halves, chopped</li>
<li>8 Kalamata olives, de-stoned and chopped</li>
<li>chopped fresh parsley, to garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Cook the pasta just short of al dente (the pasta I used takes 12 min to cook al dente, I cooked it for 11 min) following the instructions on the packet, saving about 60 ml / ¬º cup of cooking water just before you drain your pasta.
</li>
  <li>Heat up 2 tsp oil in a non-stick pan (I like to use a stainless steel one for this dish). Once hot, add zucchini and fry it on a gentle heat until caramelised, stirring from time to time.
</li>
  <li>Once zucchini is almost done, add the garlic and allow it to fry in amongst the zucchini, stirring frequently. Do not let it brown as it will make it taste bitter.</li>
  <li>Season with salt and pepper and transfer out of the pan. Set aside.
</li>
  <li>Add chopped tomatoes and a good splash of water (or vegan wine if you‚Äôd like) into the same pan.
</li>
  <li>Allow the tomatoes to break down and thicken a little. Add a splash more liquid if the pan is getting dry.
</li>
  <li>Season the sauce with salt, pepper, a pinch of sugar (if using), balsamic vinegar and a pinch of chilli if using. Stir well. Add cherry tomato halves to the pan, allow the cherry tomatoes to soften in the sauce.
</li>
  <li>Add drained pasta to the sauce and a bit of pasta cooking water if needed. Coat the pasta in the tomato sauce. Mix well and adjust the seasoning if needed ‚Äì remember that olives will add saltiness. At this point you may want to add a touch more olive oil for a more luxurious finish.
</li>
  <li>Finally return fried zucchini and add chopped artichoke hearts and olives to the pan.
</li>
  <li>Divide between two bowls and sprinkle with fresh parsley.
</li>
</ol>
